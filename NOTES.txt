what makes the rect outline when viewing fullscreen? it's in aText! and Hotspot & txtcntnr [window and dialogue] dont do that, if "global" do in Core or Scene

note how i've set win params in textcontainer & text as Externs, defined in Scene

screens need a "title"?

text & tcont  could have default colors so XML only  uses RGB if overriding

R,G,B implementation good but commas may complicate CSV conversion

registerHotspot (text, textcontainer): slightly changed check for NULL
