why do we start outside?

screens need a "title"?

the rect outline when viewing fullscreen? it's in aText! and Hotspot & txtcntnr [window and dialogue] dont do that, if "global" do in Core or Scene

note how i've set win params in textcontainer & text as Externs, defined in Scene



text & tcont  could have default colors so XML only  uses RGB if overriding

R,G,B implementation good but commas may complicate CSV conversion

registerHotspot (text, textcontainer): slightly changed check for NULL



inventory UI? click on an item in the inventory panel, it sticks to cursor, roll to a loc in scene, click to drop
what happens in the scenegraph? adding a Node using the same Text Asset
(but also the orig node in orig scene STILL "HAS" same Asset, but not visible)
ISSUE: if same Asset in new scene, now visible, what property is that?
hmmm. maybe TAKING removes asset from Node (so you now have an 'empty node' in orig scene)
OR, just change nodeNum of the Asset and if it doesnt match Node that's trying to draw it, dont draw it <--
